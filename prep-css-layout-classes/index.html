        <h3> 1. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>
        <h4>¥40.32 Billion</h4>
        <p>Based on the manga written &amp; illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is the most successful Japanese
        movie in history. It holds all the box-office records to its name as it collected more than $500 million worldwide
        becoming the highest-grossing anime movie of 2020.</p>
        <p>This was the first time a non-Hollywood film topped the annual box-office chart. Even after being released amid the
        Covid crisis, the film was able to make a huge profit of 40 billion yen in Japan. Later on, it went on to receive
        multiple awards, including the Japan Academy Film Prize for Best Animation in 2021.</p>
        <p>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is an action-adventure anime movie about the Flame Hashira Rengoku Kyojuro and the troublesome
        trio of Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke who boards a train to investigate the mystery about the disappearance of 40 people
        from a moving train.</p>

        <h3>2. Spirited Away</h3>
        <h4>¥31.68 Billion</h4>
        <p>Half of the movies listed in this section are created by popular Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki and Spirited Away is
        another one among them. It was No.1 in the list of highest-grossing anime films in Japan &amp; internationally as well,
        until Demon Slayer: Mugen Train dethroned it from the top spot.</p>

        <p>Miyazaki wrote the screenplay of Spirited Away in the 2000s and launched it on the big screen after its completion. The
        response from the movie was unbelievable as it grossed more than 31.68 billion yen in Japan and won an Oscar in
        succession as well becoming the first anime film ever to do so.</p>

        <p>Spirited Away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl Chihiro Ogino who while moving to a new neighborhood, enters the
        world of Kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore). After her parents are turned into pigs by a witch named Yubaba,
        Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human
        world.</p>

        <h3>3. Your Name</h3>
        <h4>¥25.03 Billion</h4>
        <p>Your Name is hailed to be the best anime film by well-known director &amp; filmmaker Makoto Shinkai which was released in
        the theaters in 2016. It received very positive reviews from the viewers and turned out to be the most successful
        animated film in history grossing its box-office tally to US $380 million.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it earned many recognisable awards including the 2016 Los Angeles Films Critics Association Awards and 71st
        Mainichi Film Awards for Best Animation Feature Film. Sadly, even after delivering such an Oscar deserving performance
        in the theaters, the movie didn't even get nominated for once.</p>
        <p>Your Name tells the beautiful story of two teenagers who finds themselves swapping their bodies and growing closer &amp;
        closer in this process. But, later they discover that they both exist in two different timelines. The unconditional bond
        between these two and one's attempt to protect the other is a pleasure to watch.</p>

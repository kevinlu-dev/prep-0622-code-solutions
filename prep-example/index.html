  <h1>I would like to build</h1>

    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    Outside of tech, I also love to game, watch anime/asian dramas and illustrate digital portraits... and tattoos, its a little different but hey it is what it is Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ . With this in mind, I would love to work on a site and/or app that would build upon my interest in pop culture tattoos! Taking into account my own personal
    troubles of finding tattoo artists who specifically specialize or have a niche for game/anime/comic tattoos in their portfolio or preferred style of work.
